## Debugging & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What should I do when I hit an error that won’t go away?">
    **Great question\!** You’re not alone—everyone runs into these loops sometimes.

    Here’s what we recommend:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Try to fix (free)">
        **Try fixing the error twice** using edit mode or chat mode.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Chat Mode">
        If it still loops or creates more issues, **switch fully to chat mode** and debug by explaining what you're seeing.

        Use prompts like:

        - “Explain the error and how to fix it.”
        - “List the steps you're taking and why.”
        - “What's different between this and your previous solution?”
      </Step>
      <Step title="Restore">
        If that doesn’t work, **restore a previous working version**, **remix the project**, or **report it** via Discord or paid support.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    <Info>
      Bonus tip:

      **Add a Knowledge File** early on with your vision, rules, and structure. That context helps the AI stay on track.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Where can I get help if I'm stuck?">
    - Use [**Chat Mode**](https://docs.aippy.ai/features/labs#chat-mode) for AI assistance.
    - Check [**documentation**](https://docs.aippy.ai/) for guidance.
    - Join the [**Discord community**](https://discord.gg/aippy-ai) for real-time help.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What should I do when my app breaks?">
    Here’s a safe recovery pattern:

    1. **Version tag** every stable moment.
    2. If something breaks, **don’t keep building**—revert.
    3. Remix from a working front-end version and re-implement backend or complex logic gradually.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I avoid prompt confusion or loops?">
    Give _more_ context, not less. Long, structured prompts work better:

    - Describe what the user should see, click, and do.
    - Clarify what part of the app it affects.
    - Be explicit: “Add a login button that redirects to dashboard after login (Google, Slack, email).”
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What support options do I have?">
    2 options here:

    - **Free users**: Community help via [Discord](https://discord.gg/Aippy-dev).

## About Aippy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the difference between Aippy & other AI builders?">
    People say Aippy has higher quality outputs, ship faster, better at full stack and more.

    That's kind of the break-down why we would recommend Aippy:

    - **Supabase integration**: Aippy just makes it smoother. You connect with an API key and you're good to go. No hoops.
    - **Image uploads** actually work. Didn’t have to debug anything.
    - **GitHub commits** show up cleanly as external updates. Easy to track changes.
    - **Precision edits with the visual editor** — it’s free. You can tweak small UI things without breaking stuff. It just feels like Figma was naturally integrated.
    - **"Try to fix" is free**, too. You don’t get punished for iterating.
    - **Chat mode** is way more natural. Feels like pair programming with an actual teammate.
    - **UX/UI output** is just better. It looks like something you'd actually ship.
    - **Product output is usable**. You get real controls, working links, multiple pages — not just a static playground.
    - **Community** is much bigger & more helpful and active.
    - **We're more ambitious** in terms of what they’re enabling - product and brand itself.
    - **Attention to detail** shows everywhere — naming, layouts, error handling.

    Other AI builders may still be valid solutions, but [<u>Aippy.dev</u>](http://Aippy.dev/) feels more full-stack ready and thoughtful.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is the difference between Aippy & Cursor?">
    **Aippy and Cursor are both $20/month tools that help you build software with AI.** But they serve different needs, especially if you're just starting out.
