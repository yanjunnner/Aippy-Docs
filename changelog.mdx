### 🎉 Aippy's First Release - The Beginning of Something Amazing!

We’re beyond excited to introduce the **first-ever release of Aippy** – your AI-powered sidekick for turning ideas into fully functional apps, without writing a single line of code.

After weeks of prompt-tweaking, layout-tuning, and late-night inspiration, we’re ready to open the gates. It’s time to build websites, tools, and interactive experiences — just by describing them.

#### 🚀 What’s Inside
- **AI-generated projects** – Tell Aippy what you want to build, and it does the rest.
- **Natural language to layout** – From interface to logic, no code required.
- **Live previews** – See your project unfold in real time, as you type.
- **Instant onboarding** – Get from zero to “wow” in minutes.

#### 🔧 Under the Hood
- Aippy runs on a powerful blend of LLMs, design systems, and frontend magic.
- We’ve fine-tuned the UX to be beginner-friendly, but pro-capable.
- Our prompt engine has been tested with wild, wonderful use cases — and it’s ready for yours.

#### 🔮 What’s Next?
- More component variety, smarter logic generation, and better context awareness.
- We’re shaping Aippy’s roadmap based on your ideas, creations, and feedback.
- Have a feature in mind? Let us know — you’re building Aippy with us.
