## **Who Can Contact Support?**

Support is available to customers using Aippy resources if:

1. The request is submitted via an official support channel (see below).
2. The request originates from a registered Aippy account email address.

## **Official Support Channels**

### **In-Product Support (Preferred)**

Paid users can submit support tickets directly inside the Aippy platform. Our AI assistant handles common queries instantly, and you can escalate to a human anytime by clicking **"Talk to a human."**

### **Web and Dashboard**

Support is also available through the [**Aippy Help & Support**](https://aippy.ai/support) page in the website.

### **Email**

If the dashboard is inaccessible, contact us at [support@aippy.ai](mailto:support@aippy.ai) using a registered Aippy account email address.

### **Community Support**

While official support requests are only handled through designated channels, our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/Aippy-dev) offers peer-to-peer assistance.

- Use Discord for workflow help, prompting questions, or project structure tips.
- Always include clear details (e.g., prompt, message ID, screenshots) for better responses.

**Note:** Aippy team members and champions may participate in community discussions, but official support is only guaranteed through the designated support system.

## **Proactive Monitoring**

For platform-wide issues, updates will be posted on:

- Our [official Changelog page](https://docs.aippy.ai/changelog)
- The #announcement channel on [Aippy Discord](https://discord.gg/Aippy-dev)

There’s no need to submit support tickets for ongoing platform issues. The changelog and Discord will provide real-time updates.

## **Enterprise Support**

Enterprise Plan customers have access to Premium Support options, including direct Slack channels, shared sessions, and faster SLAs.

For details, contact us via the [Premium Support Inquiry form](https://cal.com/sebastian-schaaf/connect-with-Aippy).

## **Reminder**

If you're stuck, the fastest path to resolution is:

1. Use **chat mode** to understand what went wrong.
2. Ask: "What happened? What file was changed? How do we fix this?"
3. If it loops, switch to **chat-only debugging.**
4. Tag or restore a stable version before retrying.
5. Use the **Knowledge File** to lock in goals, structure, and rules.
